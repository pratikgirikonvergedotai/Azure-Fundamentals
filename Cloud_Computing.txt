What is cloud Computing ? 

The practice of using a network of remote servers hosted on the Internet 
to store, manage and process data, rather than a local server or a personal computer 


On-premise : 

- you own the servers

- you hire the IT people 

- you pay or rent the real-estate

- you take all the risk



Cloud Providers :

- Someone else owns the servers

- Someone else hires the IT people 

- Someone else pays or rents the real-estate

- you responsible for your configuring cloud services and code , someone else takes care 
  of the rest
