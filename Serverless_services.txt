what is serverless ?

when the underlying servers , infrastructure and os is taken care of by the 
cloud service provider it will generally be highly available , scalable and cost effective 



event-driven scale : 
serverless function can be triggered or trigger other evnets allowing you 
to compose complex applications and its just scales




abstraction of servers : 
servers are abstracted away. your code is described as functions . these functions can 
be running on different compute instances



micro-billing:
serverless compute could run for a fraction of a second . billing into micro seconds 
will save you money
 


Azure functions : 
run small amounts of code known as serverless functions in your favorite language:
c# , java, javascript, python and powershell


blog storage:
serverless object storage . just upload files. dont think about the underlying file systems, resizing


logical apps:
allows you to build serverless workflows composed of azure functions building a state machines for serverless compute 
 

event grid:
pub/sub messaging system to allow you react to events and trigger other azure cloud servers such as azure funcitons
