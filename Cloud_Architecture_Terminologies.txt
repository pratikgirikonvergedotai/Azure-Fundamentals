High Avaliablity : 
your ability to ensure a service remains available 
your ability for your service to remain available by ensuring there is no single point of 
failure and/or ensure a certain level of performance . running your workloads across multiple
availability zones ensures that if 1 or 2 az's become unavailable your service/applications
remains available. use azure load balancer to evenly distribute traffic to multiple servers




High Scalability : 
your ability to grow rapidly or unimpeded
your ability to increase your capacity based on the increasing demand of traffic, 
memory and computing power

types of scaling :
1) vertical (Scaling Up) : Upgrade to bigger server
2) horizontal (Scaling out) : add more servers of the same size





High Elasticity : 
your ability to shrink and grow to meet the demand
your ability to automatically increase or decrease your capacity based on the current 
demand of traffic, memory and computing power

we use horizontal scaling for this: 
1) scaling out - add more servers of the same size
2) scaling in - remove more servers of the same size

vertical scaling is generally hard for traditional architecture so you'll usually only see 
horizontal scaling described with elasticity.

some tools for elasticity : azure vm scale sets , sql server stretch database








High Durability : 
your ability to prevent failure
your ability to recover from a disaster and to prevent the loss of data solutions that 
recover from a disaster is known as Disaster Recovery (DR)

QUESTIONS TO BE HIGHLY DURABLY

- Do you have a backup ? 
- How fast can you restore that backup ?
- Does your backup still work ?
- How do you ensure current live data is not corrupt ?








Fault Tolerance : your ability to recover from failure
